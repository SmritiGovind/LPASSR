Lightweight Stereo Image Super resolution
Proposes a novel and simple SSR approach that incorporates depth-wise separable convolutions and a PAM, and depth-wise separable convolutions to extract features from both left and right. Thus achieves a light weight design while still delivering comparable results in stereo image enhancement
